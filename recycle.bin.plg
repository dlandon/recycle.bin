<CHANGES>
##&name;
###&version;
- Fix: Extend the start up after array has started to 30 seconds to be sure all activity has settled.
- Fix: Change the way samba reloads a changed configuration.

###2025.02.25
- Add: Adjust some timing when restarting the recycle bin.

###2025.02.24
- Fix: Event to refresh the recycle bin after a share edit was not working.  The recycle bin has to be updated after a share change.
- Fix: Start the Recycle Bin when Unraid is started and not when disks are mounted.
- Add: Move the Share browse icon to the left of the share name to be more consistent with Unraid standard.
- Add: Change the deleted file log to inotify events and not extd_audit.  Samba is moving files and not necessarily deleting them.  The Samba logging mechanism is difficult to implement and changes too much.  Inotify will now monitor all file activity to the /.Recycle.Bin folders on all shares.
- Add: Use a FIFO mechanism for inotify events so log events will not get lost.
- Add: Scroll to the bottom of the deleted files log when the page is refreshed.

- Add: Ability to set up to one share sub-directory when excluding directories from shares.  i.e. /share/directory/sub-directory.
- Fix: Change daily and weekly cron times to 5 AM.  The idea is to have the recycle bin purge occur when disks are already spinning.
- Fix: Rewrite 'find' command to handle the symlinks in the /mnt/RecycleBin/ folder.
- Fix: Tweak the RecycleBin mount point creation.
- Fix: Change trash size refresh to every 5 minutes.  On large Recycle Bins every minute is too much processing and the Recycle Bin really doesn't change that much.
